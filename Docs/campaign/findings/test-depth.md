# Test depth pass, campaign/test-depth

Property tests, fuzzed inputs and coverage measurement across the workspace. Goal: bugs no
hand-written test would reach, plus durable tests left behind.

Branch: `campaign/test-depth`, cut from `campaign/2026-09-21` at 49917423.

Constraint from the campaign: other agents own `crates/al-analysis` and
`crates/al-lsp/src/server/daemon` non-test source. Bugs found there are recorded here with a
minimal input and the test is marked `#[ignore = "finding: ..."]` so this branch stays green.
Bugs in other crates are fixed with the test.
